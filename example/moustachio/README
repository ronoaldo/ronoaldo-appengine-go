This program requires the freetype-go library.

It must be installed into your GOPATH so the relevant package can by
imported by Moustachio. You can do this by running the following command:

        goapp get code.google.com/p/freetype-go/freetype/raster

Where goapp is the binary in the root of the Go App Engine SDK.
